A Pygame-based wannabe Plant Evolution Simulator (PlES)

-----Features-----

-Creating new worlds with a selectable world type

-Saving worlds on the `worlds` folder

-Loading worlds from the `worlds` folder

-Seeing plants evolve spontaneously from the natural conditions given

The worlds are easily recreatable thanks to the simplicity of their generation:
they use a seed for the Perlin Noise map and a World Type which determines specifics that can make the world look different ways with the same seed.
